# Difference-in-Differences (DiD) Replication Project

This repository contains a replication-style empirical exercise implementing the **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** framework for policy evaluation using panel data.  
The project is developed as part of a graduate-level econometrics course and serves as a methodological portfolio demonstrating applied causal inference skills.

## Project Overview
The analysis applies standard DiD and **Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE)** estimators to evaluate the impact of a policy intervention on voting turnout outcomes.  
The focus is on estimation, interpretation, and critical assessment of identifying assumptions rather than exact replication of published results.

## Methodology
- Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
- Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE)
- Event-study specification for dynamic treatment effects  
- Emphasis on effect magnitude, statistical significance, and substantive relevance

## Data
- County-level panel data (structure aligned with course materials)
- Data used in this repository are **not identical** to those in the original study
- All observations are treated with equal weights, following assignment guidelines

## Repository Structure
- `01_*.do / .ipynb` : Main estimation scripts  
- `outputs/` : Tables or figures generated from the analysis (if applicable)

## Project Status
This repository is a **work in progress**.  
Additional robustness checks, alternative specifications, and documentation may be added incrementally.

## Notes on Use
- This repository is intended for **academic demonstration and learning purposes**
- Results should not be interpreted as definitive policy evaluation outcomes
- Code and interpretation emphasize transparency and replicability
